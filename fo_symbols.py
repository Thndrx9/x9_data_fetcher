"""
fo_symbols.py — F&O-eligible underlying list, sourced from OpenAlgo.

Problem this solves: NSE's Closing Auction Session (CAS) only applies to
stocks that have active F&O (futures & options) contracts — those stocks
stop continuous trading at 15:15, while every other stock keeps trading
normally to 15:30. candle_archiver.py needs to know, per symbol, which
group it's in, so it can stop building candles at 15:15 for F&O symbols
specifically, without cutting off real trading data for everyone else.

Rather than scraping NSE's website (session/cookie handling, a daily-
changing download URL), this asks OpenAlgo directly — it already
maintains a master instrument list, including the NFO (F&O) segment,
via its own /api/v1/instruments endpoint. Every NFO row carries a
"name" field: the underlying's symbol. Collecting that field across
every NFO row gives the complete, current F&O-eligible set, in the
same OpenAlgo standard symbol format symbols.csv already uses — no
separate mapping needed.

The F&O-eligible list itself changes rarely (NSE reviews it every few
months, not daily — see SEBI's periodic eligibility criteria), so this
doesn't need to be fetched on every archiver run. It's cached to a
local JSON file and only re-fetched once the cache is older than
FO_LIST_MAX_AGE_HOURS (default 24h — i.e. refreshed at most once a
day), matching how often OpenAlgo's own master contracts typically
refresh.

Usage:
    from x9_data_fetcher.fo_symbols import get_fo_underlyings
    fo_set = get_fo_underlyings(api_key)
    is_fo = "RELIANCE" in fo_set

Safe to call even if the fetch fails (network issue, OpenAlgo down,
bad API key) — falls back to whatever's in the cache file, however
stale, or an empty set if there's no cache at all yet. Never raises.
